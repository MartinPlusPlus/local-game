# local-game
A game that can be hosted on a raspberry pi and be connected to by a small amount of people

## Server Setup
This project is designed to run on a raspberry pi, however it is very possible that it could be run on something else. This is what you will need to do:
* Create a server (preferably something running linux)
* Install python3 to the Server
    * `apt-get`, `pacman`, etc.
